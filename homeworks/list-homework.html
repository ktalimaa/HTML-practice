<h3>The House that Jack Built lyrics</h3>
<ol>
    <li>This is the house that Jack built.<br>
        This is the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
        That tossed the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the maiden all forlorn,<br>
        That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
        That tossed the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the man all tattered and torn,<br>
        That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
        That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
        That tossed the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the priest all shaven and shorn,<br>
        That married the man all tattered and torn,<br>
        That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
        That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
        That tossed the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the cock that crowed in the morn,<br>
        That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,<br>
        That married the man all tattered and torn,<br>
        That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
        That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
        That tossed the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
    </li>
    <li>This is the farmer sowing the corn,<br>
        That kept the cock that crowed in the morn.<br>
        That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,<br>
        That married the man all tattered and torn,<br>
        That kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
        That milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
        That tossed the dog,<br>
        That worried the cat,<br>
        That killed the rat,<br>
        That ate the malt,<br>
        That lay in the house that Jack built.
